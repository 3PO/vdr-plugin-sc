Please use the name of the release you're basing on as a base name and
add your suffix.

For example if john modifies
  FFdecsa-1.0.0
he should release
  FFdecsa-1.0.0-john_0.3
or
  FFdecsa-1.0.0-john_0.4

If paul modifies john's version the correct name would be like
  FFdecsa-1.0.0-john_0.4-paul_0.1

This is to avoid many different versions with random version numbers, as
development is not centralized.

Thank you.
